You can add the methods and members you consider needed.

Create a *main.cpp* file that creates 2 Banks, and allows you to test ALL the Bank methods using terminal commands.

## Submitting

Create a new **private** GitHub repository named *"2019_1_d3_prc1_Lastname1Firstname1_Lastname2Firstname2"* (E.g. *"2018_2_d3_prc1_CamachoCamilo_PerezPepito"*), and add as collaborators to all your team partners, and the account *edgarcamilocamacho*. The repository must contain:

* Makefile: with rules to compile each class, and the complete project, all (by default), run and clean.
* main.cpp
* bank.cpp & bank.h
* account.cpp & account.h
* client.cpp & client.h
* README.md: The report

Then, download it as *zip* and upload it to the corresponding *moodle* task. **Important**: when submitting the task to moodle, include the *github* repository link, and the name of all the members of the team.
