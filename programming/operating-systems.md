# Operating Systems

## Course description

Modern computer systems involve more than one processor, main memory, storage devices, keyboard, mouse, network interfaces, displays, and a number of other peripherals that allow them to perform the complex tasks that user needs to be done.

From the programmer side, managing all of these resources in each application that he develops, and the using of file system, would cause a huge amount of elapsed time in the developing process. In addition, the debug and problem solution processes would be very slow and tedious. From the end user side, using peripherals like mouse, display, printers and so, would be very complicated without something that link them.

The operating systems close the gap between the end user/high level programmer and the computer hardware, providing tools, APIs, and links that allow the using of the system resources with a mimimum knowledge about how they work.

This course aims to introduce the student to operating systems, it's relationship with hardware, the using of its tools, and the methods that a programmer can use to manage resources in a better way.
