# Lab 1

Using the commands of the items:

* [Importing Images](https://github.com/cstopics/cstopics/blob/gh-pages/assets/notebooks/vision/import_image.ipynb){:target="blank"}
* [Processing in the Spatial Domain](https://github.com/cstopics/cstopics/blob/gh-pages/assets/notebooks/vision_notebooks/01_Spatial_Domain.ipynb){:target="blank"}

And having the following image (right-click and save image...):

<div class="picture">
  <img style="width:100%;" src ="/cstopics/assets/notebooks/vision_notebooks/images/00_photo2.jpeg" />
</div>

Process it in the spatial domain (manually), to get an image as close as you can to the following:

<div class="picture">
  <img style="width:100%;" src ="/cstopics/assets/notebooks/vision_notebooks/images/00_photo1.jpeg" />
</div>

Create an jupyter notebook where you explain each modification that you do to the image, why did you do it, and the another sections you consider (it means that your notebook is your laboratory report, so it must have the name of the students, abstract, introduction, practice development, results and conclusions).

Remember that the notebook must be able to be executed in the teacher's computer, so if you need a new library, or aditional files, include it when you submit.

When it is ready, upload it to the appropriate link in moodle.

Deadline: Feb 24, 23:59
